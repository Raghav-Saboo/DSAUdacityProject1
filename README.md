Time Complexities of each task

Task 0

- Worst-case time complexity is O(1)
- The time complexity for this program is O(1) because we are accessing the
  first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index.

Task 1

- Worst-case time complexity is O(n)
- The time complexity for this program is O(n) because we are iterating over
  both the lists (calls and texts) one time.

Task 2

- Worst-case time complexity is O(n)
- The time complexity for this program is O(n) because we are iterating over
  both the lists (calls and texts) one time.

Task 3

- Worst-case time complexity is O(nlog(n))
- The time complexity for this program is O(nlog(n)) because we are iterating
  over calls list and then sorting the area codes before printing.

Task 4 - O(n)

- Worst-case time complexity is O(nlog(n))
- The time complexity for this program is O(nlog(n)) because we are iterating
  over both the lists (calls and texts) one time and then sorting the result
  before printing.
